A basic React experiment using public APIs or whatever CORS-free APIs I could find.

This project could probably be reused by whoever given that they have access to whatever working APIs might be available. The code is free to use.

The whole purpose of this little toy was to create a self-updating, better visual framework for COVID-related dashboards. Work is still in progress.

Don't expect a final result too soon. I might as well drop this project anytime if I get bored. Also, do not expect it to run forever, as it is at the mercy of the APIs owners. If they pull the plug, oh well.
